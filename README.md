# Telecom Customer_Churn_Prediction - Telecommunication company
This project focuses on predicting customer churn in a telecommunication industry using machine learning algorithms. 

# Problem Statement
The objective of this project is to develop a predictive model that can accurately identify customers who are likely to churn from a telecommunication service provider. 
By proactively identifying these customers, the telecommunication company can take appropriate retention measures to minimize customer churn and improve business outcomes.

# Dataset
The dataset used for this project gathred from Kaggle and contains a set of customer attributes, usage patterns, and churn status. It consists of the following key features:

CustomerID: this represents the unique id for each ustomer.

Age: this represents the age of the corresponding customers.

Gender: gender of the customer

tenure: this is time or period that the customer hold with the same telecommunication service provider

usage frequency: this feature represnts the how frequently customer using the same service proveider.

payment delay: how much time thtat the customer has been delaying to pay the bill amount.

subscription type: represnts the type of subscription that the customer using.

contract length: time period that the customer taking the service.

total sspend : the total amount of money spend by the customer.

last interaction: feature that represnts the last time that the customer having the utility of the service.

Churn: Target variable indicating whether a customer has churned 1 or not as 0.

# Data Preparation and  data mining:
i) Loading the dataset and after importing the necessary libraries.
i) Data cleaning and handling missing values.
iii) Encoding categorical variables if needed.
iv) Splitting the data into training and testing sets.
v) Exploratory Data Analysis.
